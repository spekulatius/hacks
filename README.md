# Hacks / Playground

Several hacks and alpha code. Experiments - not stable at all. And definitely not maintained in the long run. If something ends up being useful it will be migrated into a proper repo.

I also maintain a little repo about [interesting web-stuff](https://github.com/spekulatius/web-stuff) with discoveries on GitHub and the Internet in general.
