# Web-Scraping tests with Puppeteer

Scraping stuff from the web using Puppeteer. Background: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzZ3YOUhCxo)

Playing around with selectors, headless browsers, etc. to potentially add something along these lines in my [PHP scraping library](https://phpscraper.de) ([GitHub](https://github.com/spekulatius/phpscraper)).

Tested using node 12.18.2 (over nvm).
