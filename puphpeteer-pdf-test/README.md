# PuPHPeteer PDF Generation Test

Playing around with [PuPHPeteer](https://github.com/rialto-php/puphpeteer/) to get used to it and trying to replicate [this bug](https://github.com/rialto-php/puphpeteer/issues/82).

## Setup

```bash
composer install
yarn
```

## Run

```bash
php index.php
```

This should save the rendered PDF as ```/tmp/test.pdf```.
